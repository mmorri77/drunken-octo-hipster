    README!
    I'm writing this as a quick and dirty way to get us going.  Often, when learning a new language or technique, 
    it can be helpful to play around with something working.  Making changes, seeing what happens, breaking things and 
       then fixing them, and otherwise tinkering can be an effective way to understand new material.  
     
    Toward that end, I decided it might be useful to set up a simple project base for us to hack on while we're finding 
    our legs for this project.  
    
    I chose Paper.js because it is relatively easy to get started with, it is the JS graphics library I personally have 
    the most experience with (so I can be of more help), and because it seems to meet our needs pretty well.  This does 
    not mean we have to stick with Paper as the framework of choice for this project, but it should provide us with a 
    good way to get our feet wet.  
   
    INSTRUCTIONS!
    To get started, simply load this file (index.html) file into a modern (read: standards compliant) browser, and you 
    should see a colored circle in the center of the screen.  The html file itself is merely the container that provides us 
    with a structure to use when building our program.  The logic of the program is contained within this file, while the 
    functionality of Paper is contained within the paper.js file.  The index.html file creates the DOM (Document Object Model) 
    that will be manipulated by our code (this file) and links to the appropriate js files (this and paper.js).  
    
    Clear as mud?

        First, we'll make a simple red circle.  In Paper.js, we have an object prototype 
        called 'Path' to use to draw with.  Paths in Paper are just like paths you might've 
        seen in drawing programs, such as Illustrator.  A path is a collection of points connected 
        by curves.  (Note:  a 'curve' might have a curvature of zero--i.e. a straight line.)
        
        The path object comes with some handy built-in constructors for common shapes.  Here, we're 
        going to use the Path.Circle(c,r) function, where c is the center and r is the radius.

        separate event.  
        
        Event objects contain information about the event that triggered them.  In this 
        case, we examine the event.key to find out which key was released.
